                    <p>
                        Before diving into
                        coding I competed professionally in StarCraft 2, where I honed my strategic thinking and adaptability.

                    <p>
                        Now, I apply those same skills to writing clean, efficient code and tackling complex challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also have an interest in competitive programming, where I enjoy pushing my problem-solving abilities
                        even further.
